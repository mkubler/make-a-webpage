Building a website in HTML 
 
 My name is Matt. I'm making this project for Udacity classes: Intro into programming.
Currently I ran into my first problem so I've openend this repository on github to share my code. 
Currently this is a finished product and it's under review by a Udacity reviewer.

I have made revisions to my project and submitted for review again
